# TriggerSeq

A performance-oriented sequencer that is triggered by incoming MIDI notes.

Thanks to Kevin F. for the original idea and for pushing me farther into what is shaping up to be a really cool and useful little tool.

Now with polyphonic support, chuck your chords into the TriggerSeq to see what comes out the other side.

Use it with a monosynth like a 303 clone and dig into the new Tie function to slide up and down octaves from step-to-step.

Store 16 presets and and recall them with a parameter knob, enabling a different kind of live performance.

## Features
- Incoming notes trigger a sequence
- Pitch can be absolute or relative
- Scale awareness optional
- Velocity can be absolute or relative
- Duration is multiples of a base
- Rests are supported (non-playing pattern slots)
- Switch to choke or play through if a MIDI note arrives before the sequence is done playing
- Time can be notes or ms
- `Swing` control.
- `Mono` or `Poly` operation (8 voice support)
- 16 automatable snapshot presets
- `Tie` function to work nicely with 303s and other monosynths with portamento
